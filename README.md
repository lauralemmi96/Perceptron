# Perceptron
Implementation of a perceptron on Zync Xilinx FPGA using vhdl language.
A Perceptron models a neuron. It is a type of artificial neuron, an elec- tronic device which was implemented in agreement with biological principles and showed an ability to learn. The Perceptron algorithm classifies patterns and groups by finding the linear separation between different objects and patterns that are received through numeric or visual input. A sigmoid has been used as activation function. The project is divided in two parts, summation processor and activation function.
To implement the sigma part first, is considered the size of the outputs of the summation. Each 8-bit input must be multiplied by weight with the same index as itself. Then all of these ten multiplications and the bias are added together. It is also consider all the possible values for Xs and weights. As they can get 3 different values [0,1,-1], It is used MatLab coding to generate random values for each of them. The result of the previous block will be the input for the activation function. All the possible results of the activation functions are calculated using matlab and saved in a lookup table.
Also the Matlab code has been provided.
